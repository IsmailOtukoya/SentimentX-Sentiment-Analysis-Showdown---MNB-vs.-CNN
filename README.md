# SentimentX-Sentiment-Analysis-Showdown---MNB-vs.-CNN

 I present a comprehensive comparative study on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using two popular approaches: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This study aims to analyze and compare the performance of these techniques in accurately predicting the sentiment expressed in movie reviews.

Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding public opinion and sentiment towards movies, products, and various other domains. Movie reviews, in particular, provide a rich source of textual data for sentiment analysis, as they often contain subjective expressions of positive or negative sentiments.

In this study, I explore two widely used methods for sentiment analysis. First, I employ MNB, a probabilistic algorithm that leverages the frequencies of words to make sentiment predictions. MNB is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in text classification tasks. Second, I utilize CNN, a deep learning approach that can automatically learn hierarchical features from text data, capturing complex patterns and contextual information.

To conduct the study, I utilize a labeled dataset of movie reviews, where each review is annotated with a positive or negative sentiment label. I preprocess the textual data by applying techniques like tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words. For MNB, I represent the reviews as Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF vectors, while for CNN, I utilize word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.

By implementing both MNB and CNN models, I compare their performances in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, I evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics and visualize the results to provide a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses in sentiment analysis tasks.

The GitHub repository associated with this study provides detailed code examples, data preprocessing techniques, model implementation, and evaluation procedures. It serves as a valuable resource for sentiment analysis enthusiasts and researchers, enabling them to explore and compare the MNB and CNN approaches in the context of movie review sentiment analysis.

Through this comparative study, we gain insights into the trade-offs between traditional machine learning (MNB) and deep learning (CNN) approaches for sentiment analysis. By understanding their respective strengths and limitations, developers and researchers can make informed decisions when choosing the appropriate technique for sentiment analysis tasks in various domains.
